## 📈 1. Line Chart

### 🔹 Purpose:

To show **trends over time** or continuous data relationships.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* To visualize how a variable changes over time or sequence.
* To compare multiple trends on the same axis.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Stock market price trends over months.
* CPU temperature variations throughout the day.
* Sales figures over weeks.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A "timeline" of values, showing growth, decline, or patterns.

## 📊 2. Bar Chart

### 🔹 Purpose:

To compare **discrete categories** using rectangular bars.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* To show comparison across categories.
* To visualize counts, scores, or quantities.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Number of students in each department.
* Revenue by product category.
* Population across different cities.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A direct **comparison tool** for individual items.

## 📉 3. Histogram

### 🔹 Purpose:

To show the **distribution of continuous data**.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* To see how data is **spread out** (normal, skewed, bimodal).
* To identify outliers or patterns in large datasets.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Age distribution of survey participants.
* Exam score distribution in a class.
* Frequency of transactions by amount range.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A **frequency map** that shows “how often” values appear.

## 🔴 4. Scatter Plot

### 🔹 Purpose:

To explore **relationships between two numeric variables**.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* To find correlations, clusters, or anomalies.
* To visualize data for regression or classification.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Height vs. Weight of individuals.
* Hours studied vs. exam scores.
* Marketing spend vs. revenue.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A **relationship checker** to see patterns or trends in paired data.

## 🥧 5. Pie Chart

### 🔹 Purpose:

To show **part-to-whole relationships**.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* When proportions are more important than exact values.
* When showing how a whole breaks down into parts.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Market share of mobile phone brands.
* Budget allocation by department.
* Browser usage percentages.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A **visual slice of the pie**, showing percentage contributions.

---

## 🔳 6. Subplots

### 🔹 Purpose:

To show **multiple visualizations side-by-side** in one figure.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* To compare different aspects of the same data.
* To show different chart types together.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Dashboard for temperature, humidity, and pressure.
* Comparing training vs. testing results in ML.
* Multi-metric project performance.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A **dashboard view** for side-by-side visual context.

---

## 🌐 7. 3D Plot

### 🔹 Purpose:

To visualize **three-dimensional data** or complex surfaces.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* To model spatial or multi-dimensional relationships.
* For simulations or mathematical surfaces.

### 🔹 Real-Life Examples:

* Elevation maps or terrain surfaces.
* Stress-strain simulations in engineering.
* Neural network loss landscapes in ML training.

### 🧠 Think of it as:

A way to **feel depth or surface behavior** of data.
